# HAPS_proj
HAPS Project


### Motivation

##### Personally, I don't have any experience of verilog, therefore it is very challenging for me to finish this project. I create a netlist of Synchronous 4-bit Adder, and convert their input with clock input. It's a simple netlist, but still makes me learned to do a full flow of FPGA implement with HAPS Protocompiler & vivado.
